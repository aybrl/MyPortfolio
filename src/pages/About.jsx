                    <p>Hello, World! It's <b>AY<sub>OUB</sub> B<sub>E</sub>R<sub>HI</sub>L<sub>I</sub></b>, I'm a software engineer and computer enthusiast, I hold a BS degree in computer science, and currently preparing a MS degree in software engineering at the University of Paris-Est CrÃ©teil in France ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·. I love mathematics and computers ðŸ¤– and I deeply enjoy playing with them both.</p>
                    <p>My area of expertis is designing and building safe, relieable, and scalable systems that are easy to maintain over time. I tend to work on the analytical and strategical part of the projects and everything that has something to do with logical thinking. I work on the fornt-end too, however, I'm not a big fan of UI/UX design,  I believe it's because of my lack of the creative intelligence.</p>
                    <p>Here are the technologies that I work with <a href= "/skills">My Skills</a>. And here, you can find some projects I worked on <a href= "/portfolio">My Projects</a>.</p>
